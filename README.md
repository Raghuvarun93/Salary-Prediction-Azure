- Feature: YearsExperience
- Target: Salary

## Methodology
- Dataset uploaded to Azure Machine Learning Studio
- Regression model trained using Azure AutoML
- Model performance visualized using Azure dashboard
- Salary prediction generated using test input

## Dashboard
The Azure Machine Learning dashboard displays model evaluation metrics and a predicted vs actual salary graph.

## Prediction
The trained model predicts employee salary based on years of experience.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Azure Machine Learning
- Azure AutoML
- Python (Azure ML SDK)
- CSV Dataset
